## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information

- **Filename:** `electric_vehicles_spec_2025.csv`
- **Format:** CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Source:** Kaggle

## ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning (in Microsoft Excel)

The dataset was cleaned using the following steps:

### 1. Formatting
- Adjusted **row height** and **column width** for improved readability and presentation.

### 2. Styling Headers
- Added a **blue background** to all column headers.
- Applied **bold formatting** to header text.
- Changed header **text color to white** for better contrast.

### 3. Handling Missing Data
- Identified **empty cells** and replaced them with `"NA"` values.
- Checked for and **removed empty rows** to clean up the sheet.

### 4. Removing Duplicates
- Checked for duplicate rows and **removed all duplicates** to maintain data integrity.

### 5. Data Validation
- Implemented **Excel data validation** to:
  - Restrict data types (e.g., numeric values only in certain columns).
  - Ensure consistency in text fields (e.g., brand names).
  - Prevent invalid entries that could distort analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Focus

The cleaned dataset was analyzed to extract key insights including:

- Most common **electric vehicle brands**
- Relationships between **battery capacity** and **vehicle range**
- Market **distribution** and **efficiency** comparisons

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations (Created in Excel)

A variety of Excel chart types were used to visualize the data:

- **Bar Charts:** Count of vehicles per brand
- **Pie Charts:** Distribution of vehicles by battery type
- **Line Charts:** Range and efficiency over time or models
- **Scatter Plots:** Comparing battery capacity vs. driving range
